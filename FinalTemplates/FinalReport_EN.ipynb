When we research a dataset for COVID-19 we learned symptoms of pneumonia is same. After that, we changed the our topic. We select the pneumonia problem."

    "#### What is the Pneumonia?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pneumonia is a lung infection that can range from mild to so severe that you have to go to the hospital. It happens when an infection causes the air sacs in your lungs (your doctor will call them alveoli) to fill with fluid or pus. That can make it hard for you to breathe in enough oxygen to reach your bloodstream. Anyone can get this lung infection. But infants younger than age 2 and people over age 65 are at higher risk. That’s because their immune systems might not be strong enough to fight it. Causes include bacteria, viruses, and fungi.  If your pneumonia results from bacteria or a virus, you can spread it to someone else. Lifestyle habits, like smoking cigarettes and drinking too much alcohol, can also raise your chances of getting pneumonia."

    "#### Symptoms of Pneumonia\n",
    "\n",
    "Symptoms can vary depending on what’s causing pneumonia, age, and overall health. They usually develop over several days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common pneumonia symptoms include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chest pain when you breathe or cough\n",
    "- Cough that produces phlegm or mucus\n",
    "- Fatigue and loss of appetite\n",
    "- Fever, sweating, and chills\n",
    "- Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea\n",
    "- Shortness of breath\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with these symptoms, older adults and people with weak immune systems might be confused or have changes in mental awareness, or they might have a lower-than-usual body temperature. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of infection. Or they might vomit, have a fever and a cough, and seem restless or tired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention Please** If you have a new cough, fever, or shortness of breath, call your doctor to ask about whether it could be COVID-19. Illness with the new coronavirus can also lead to pneumonia."

    "Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and a chest X-ray. In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely. However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial origin. The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chest radiograph is frequently used in diagnosis. In people with mild disease, imaging is needed only in those with potential complications, those not having improved with treatment or those in which the cause is uncertain. If a person is sufficiently sick to require hospitalization, a chest radiograph is recommended. Findings do not always match the severity of disease and do not reliably separate between bacterial infection and viral infection."
